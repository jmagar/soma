## Directories

| Directory | Contents |
|---|---|
| `adr/` | Accepted architecture decision records for the template and Rust MCP/server family. |
| `generated/` | Machine-produced artefacts committed for CI/API compatibility (e.g. `openapi.json`). |
| `contracts/` | Durable JSON Schema and example contracts (e.g. scaffold intent schema). |
| `specs/` | Design specs and handoff documents for MCP-only wizard flows. |
| `sessions/` | Saved session notes and agent handoff records. |
| `references/` | Snapshots of external specifications and tooling docs (MCP spec, registry, etc.). |

## Keeping docs current

- Update focused docs when changing commands, scripts, routes, deployment, or plugin behavior.
- Update `docs/PATTERNS.md` when a reusable repo-family pattern changes.
- Regenerate schema docs after action changes:
  ```bash
  just schema-docs
  ```
- Refresh ignored external references when needed:
  ```bash
  cargo xtask refresh-docs
  ```
- Validate before pushing:
  ```bash
  cargo xtask pre-release-check
  ```
