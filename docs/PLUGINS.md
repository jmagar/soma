# Plugin Surfaces

Soma ships one service plugin package with three host-specific entrypoints:

- Claude Code: `plugins/soma/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
- Codex: `plugins/soma/.codex-plugin/plugin.json`
- Gemini: `plugins/soma/gemini-extension.json`

All three surfaces should describe the same MCP server and expose the same
skills. Upstream-client servers should prefer a local stdio binary install for
plugin use. Application/platform servers may point plugins at the shared HTTP
MCP endpoint when a central server deployment is the source of truth. The host
manifests differ, but the service behavior should not.

The shared descriptor is `plugins/soma/plugin.surface.json`. Run
`cargo xtask generate-docs` after editing it; the Claude, Codex, and Gemini
manifests are generated from that descriptor plus `ENV_KEY_SPECS`.

The local plugin default is stdio-first. See
[`docs/adr/0001-stdio-first-plugin-adapter.md`](adr/0001-stdio-first-plugin-adapter.md)
for the accepted decision and
[`docs/contracts/plugin-stdio-adapter.md`](contracts/plugin-stdio-adapter.md)
for the exact manifest and adapter contract.

## Layout

```text
plugins/soma/
  .claude-plugin/
    plugin.json          # Claude Code manifest
  .codex-plugin/
    plugin.json          # Codex manifest
    README.md            # Codex manifest field reference
  .mcp.json              # Shared Claude/Codex MCP connection config
  gemini-extension.json  # Gemini CLI extension manifest
  hooks/
    hooks.json           # Claude lifecycle hook declarations (call the binary directly)
  skills/
    example/
      SKILL.md           # Shared action documentation
    scaffold-project/
      SKILL.md           # Approval-first Soma adaptation handoff skill
```

When adapting Soma, rename `example`, `Example`, and `EXAMPLE` consistently across the package, then update host-specific display text and credentials.

## Shared Contract

Each plugin surface should agree on:

- service name and repository URL
- MCP server name
- MCP connection profile: stdio command for local/plugin installs, or HTTP URL shape `<server_url>/mcp` for explicit remote/gateway deployments
- bearer token setting name
- upstream service credential names
- action list and skill documentation
- read/write capability claims

Keep the plugin manifests thin. Runtime setup belongs in the service binary, not in manifest-specific shell code.

## Claude Code

Claude Code uses `plugins/soma/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.

Responsibilities:

- identifies the plugin and repository
- declares `mcpServers`, `hooks`, and `skills` paths
- defines `userConfig` settings exposed in Claude Code
- marks sensitive values with `sensitive: true`

Claude-specific lifecycle hooks live in `plugins/soma/hooks/hooks.json`. The default hooks are:

| Hook | Trigger | Command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SessionStart` | every Claude Code session start | `<binary> setup plugin-hook` |
| `ConfigChange` | plugin user settings change | `<binary> setup plugin-hook` |

The hook calls the binary directly (no shell wrapper). The standard command is:

```bash
<binary> setup plugin-hook
```

For rollout audits, the binary must also support:

```bash
<binary> setup plugin-hook --no-repair
```

The hook command runs the binary already installed on `PATH`. It may map `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_*` values into runtime env vars, create the appdata directory, and call the binary's setup logic. It should not own Docker/systemd orchestration, config rewriting, smoke-test policy, or failure classification.

## Codex

Codex uses `plugins/soma/.codex-plugin/plugin.json`.

Responsibilities:

- identifies the plugin for Codex listings
- points at shared `skills` and `.mcp.json`
- describes the interface shown in Codex UI
- declares read/write capabilities
- provides example prompts
- provides branding fields such as `brandColor`, `composerIcon`, and `logo`

Codex does not use Claude lifecycle hooks. Its manifest should still point to the same MCP server and shared skills so behavior stays aligned with Claude Code.

Codex-specific fields to adapt:

| Field | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `interface.displayName` | human-readable plugin name |
| `interface.shortDescription` | short listing text |
| `interface.longDescription` | full listing text |
| `interface.capabilities` | `["Read"]` or `["Read", "Write"]` |
| `interface.defaultPrompt` | three realistic prompts |
| `interface.brandColor` | service-appropriate hex color |

See `plugins/soma/.codex-plugin/README.md` for the full manifest field reference.

## Gemini

Gemini uses `plugins/soma/gemini-extension.json`.

Responsibilities:

- identifies the extension
- declares Gemini settings
- launches the local stdio MCP adapter
- points at shared skills
- optionally points Gemini at a context file with `contextFileName`

The Gemini manifest uses `settings.*` interpolation instead of Claude/Codex `user_config.*` interpolation:

```json
"env": { "SOMA_API_URL": "${settings.soma_api_url}" }
```

Sensitive Gemini settings use:

```json
"sensitive": true
```

Keep Gemini setting names aligned with Claude/Codex where possible. For example, prefer `server_url`, `api_token`, `<service>_api_url`, and `<service>_api_key` across all three surfaces.

The generated plugin option/env mapping table lives at
[`docs/generated/plugin-settings.md`](generated/plugin-settings.md). It is
rendered from `ENV_KEY_SPECS`; update the registry first when adding plugin
settings or runtime env vars.

Shared skill action references are generated from the service-owned
`ACTION_SPECS` registry by `cargo xtask generate-docs`. When action metadata,
REST routes, or CLI/MCP visibility changes, regenerate docs and confirm the
shared skill text still matches the service registry.

## Plugin Validation

Run the plugin layout validator after changing manifests, MCP config, hooks, or
skills:

```bash
just validate-plugin
# or
scripts/validate-plugin-layout.sh
```

The validator checks:

- Claude, Codex, and Gemini manifests are valid JSON
- plugin manifests do not contain a `version` field
- manifests point to the shared `.mcp.json`, hooks, and skills paths
- shared MCP config launches `soma mcp`
- Gemini config launches `soma mcp`
- HTTP MCP remains available as a documented fallback for remote/gateway deployments
- hook config runs `<binary> setup plugin-hook` directly
- every skill has `name:` and `description:` frontmatter

Use `PLUGIN_ROOT=plugins/<service>` when validating an adapted service package.

For release checks, `just pre-release` includes this validator and the other
Soma gates.

## Shared MCP Config

Claude Code and Codex share `plugins/soma/.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "example": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "soma",
      "args": ["mcp"],
      "env": {
        "SOMA_API_URL": "${user_config.soma_api_url}",
        "SOMA_API_KEY": "${user_config.soma_api_key}",
        "RUST_LOG": "warn"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Gemini carries equivalent MCP config directly in `gemini-extension.json` because its interpolation model is different.

## Skills

`plugins/soma/skills/soma/SKILL.md` is shared across Claude, Codex, and Gemini. Every skill follows the three-tier fallback pattern — agents try each tier in order and stop when one works:

```markdown
# soma — Claude Code Skill

Use this skill whenever you need to query or manage the Soma runtime.

## Tier 1: MCP tool (preferred)
Use when the Soma MCP server is configured in your agent.

soma(action="things")
soma(action="thing", id="abc123")
soma(action="help")          # always available, no auth required

## Tier 2: CLI binary
Use when MCP is unavailable but the binary is installed in $PATH.

soma things [--json]
soma thing <id> [--json]
soma status

Env required: SOMA_API_URL, SOMA_API_KEY

## Tier 3: Direct API (last resort)
Use when neither MCP nor CLI is available.

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $SOMA_API_KEY" \
     "$SOMA_API_URL/things"

## Gotchas
- [service-specific pitfalls go here]
- [e.g. pagination, required headers, rate limits]
```

The skill should also include:

- quick action table (action → description → required params)
- full parameter reference with types
- common workflows (status check → list → inspect)
- response shapes for key actions
- sensitive-value handling notes (never log tokens, etc.)

Do not maintain separate skill docs per host. Update the shared skill when the action surface changes; Claude, Codex, and Gemini all read the same file.

## Binary-Owned Hook Standard

Every Rust server with a Claude plugin should expose:

```bash
<binary> setup plugin-hook
<binary> setup plugin-hook --no-repair
<binary> setup check
<binary> setup repair
```

`setup plugin-hook` should:

- run `setup check` first
- run `setup repair` only when needed and only when `--no-repair` is absent
- emit the setup report as structured JSON
- include `exit_policy`, `blocking_failures`, `advisory_failures`, `ran_repair`, and `no_repair`
- exit `0` for success or advisory failures
- exit nonzero for blocking failures
- enforce a bounded total hook runtime

Advisory failures are non-blocking local conditions such as missing `.env` files when process env already supplies values, occupied MCP ports, optional startup proofs, or model prewarm. Blocking failures are prerequisites required for the plugin to function, such as missing appdata directories, missing required upstream credentials, or invalid OAuth/auth configuration.

Use `scripts/check-plugin-hook-contract.py` to audit the cross-repo standard:

```bash
# Static hook/delegation checks for all known Rust servers.
scripts/check-plugin-hook-contract.py

# Also run each binary's `setup plugin-hook --no-repair` JSON contract.
scripts/check-plugin-hook-contract.py --execute
```

## Version And Release Sync

Keep version and metadata synchronized across:

| File | Fields |
| --- | --- |
| `Cargo.toml` | package `version`, homepage/repository when present |
| `plugins/soma/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` | identity, repository, user config; no `version` field |
| `plugins/soma/.codex-plugin/plugin.json` | identity, repository, interface metadata; no `version` field |
| `plugins/soma/gemini-extension.json` | identity, repository, settings |
| `server.json` | package version and registry metadata, when present |

Release-please owns Soma version bumps in normal development. On release PR
branches, use `cargo xtask sync-release-please-version` to copy
`.release-please-manifest.json` into every derived file declared in
`release/components.toml`, then use `cargo xtask check-version-sync` or
`just pre-release` to verify that version-bearing files still agree. Plugin
manifests should remain versionless.

Soma should not claim write capability unless the MCP server has real write actions. Read-only servers should use Codex `["Read"]` and avoid write-oriented sample prompts.

## Adaptation Checklist

When creating a real server from Soma:

1. Rename `example`, `Example`, and `EXAMPLE` across plugin files.
2. Update all three manifests with the real repository, description, author, keywords, and capability claims.
3. Keep credential names aligned across Claude `userConfig`, Codex shared `.mcp.json`, and Gemini `settings`.
4. Replace upstream credential fields such as `soma_api_url` and `soma_api_key`.
5. Update `apply_plugin_options()` in `crates/soma-cli/src/setup.rs` to map service-specific plugin options into env vars.
6. Implement `<binary> setup plugin-hook`, `--no-repair`, `check`, and `repair`.
7. Update shared skill docs for the actual action surface.
8. Replace Codex `defaultPrompt` entries with realistic prompts.
9. Update Gemini `description`, `settings`, and `contextFileName` if needed.
10. Run `just validate-plugin`, plugin contract tests, and `scripts/check-plugin-hook-contract.py` before release.

## Required Tests

Each server should include tests that prove:

- Claude hook config calls `<binary> setup plugin-hook` directly
- `apply_plugin_options()` maps `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_*` into the binary's env vars
- `setup plugin-hook --no-repair` parses and does not mutate appdata
- JSON plugin-hook output contains `exit_policy`, `blocking_failures`, `advisory_failures`, `ran_repair`, and `no_repair`
- advisory failures exit `0`
- blocking failures exit nonzero
- Claude, Codex, and Gemini manifests use the same service name, endpoint, token setting, and credential fields
