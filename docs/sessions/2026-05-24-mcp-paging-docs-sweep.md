# MCP Paging and Documentation Sweep

## User Request

The user asked to harden the MCP response paging behavior, verify it with real MCP tooling, continue sweeping stale docs with parallel agents, and then save the session to markdown.

## Session Overview

Implemented replay-safe MCP response paging with server-side cursors, refreshed stale template documentation across MCP/auth/plugin/deployment surfaces, extracted paging code into a focused module, and pushed the completed work to `main`.

## Sequence of Events

1. Reviewed the existing MCP response-size behavior and implemented `_response_cursor` based continuation so page fetches read cached serialized data instead of re-running the action.
2. Added protocol errors for offset-only continuation calls, invalid paging argument types, missing/expired cursors, and out-of-range offsets.
3. Verified the MCP surface with `mcporter`, including schema exposure of `_response_cursor`, normal `status`, and rejection of `_response_offset` without `_response_cursor`.
4. Dispatched three parallel read-only agents for stale docs across MCP/auth, deployment/dev, and plugin/web/scaffold areas.
5. Applied doc findings, regenerated schema docs, extracted response paging into `src/mcp/response_paging.rs`, and pushed commit `6aee3a3`.

## Key Findings

- MCP continuation needed a cursor because replaying `action=echo` with only `_response_offset` could drop required original arguments or re-run a future mutating action.
- `just contract-audit` caught that `src/mcp/rmcp_server.rs` exceeded the hard line limit after paging changes; moving paging into `src/mcp/response_paging.rs` restored the contract gate.
- Several docs still claimed stale defaults: `RTEMPLATE_MCP_HOST=0.0.0.0`, port `3100` or `3000`, `/status` requiring auth, `/metrics` being present, and plugin manifests carrying versions.
- `docs/MCP_SCHEMA.md` is generated, so reserved `_response_*` docs had to be added to `scripts/check-schema-docs.py` and regenerated.

## Technical Decisions

- Used a short-lived in-memory `ResponsePageStore` with 300-second TTL for oversized MCP result pages to avoid re-executing actions during continuation.
- Kept offset-only continuation as a protocol error with structured data because it is an adapter contract violation before business logic should run.
- Moved paging helpers and tests into `response_paging.rs` / `response_paging_tests.rs` to keep `rmcp_server.rs` under the hard file-size limit.
- Left the built-in live cursor happy path to Rust tests because the template's built-in actions do not naturally emit responses larger than the 40 KB paging threshold.

## Files Changed

| Status | Path | Previous path | Purpose | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| modified | `src/server.rs` | | Added `ResponsePageStore` and cached oversized MCP responses. | Commit `6fafbe1` |
| modified | `src/mcp/rmcp_server.rs` | | Wired paging cursor parsing and moved paging logic out to focused module. | Commit `6aee3a3` |
| created | `src/mcp/response_paging.rs` | | Owns response page request parsing, cached page reads, and page envelope generation. | Commit `6aee3a3` |
| created | `src/mcp/response_paging_tests.rs` | | Covers cursor replay, missing cursor, invalid args, and out-of-range offsets. | Commit `6aee3a3` |
| modified | `src/mcp/schemas.rs` | | Exposed `_response_cursor` and updated reserved paging descriptions. | `mcporter list` output verified |
| modified | `src/lib.rs`, `src/main.rs`, `src/mcp.rs` | | Added response page store state and module registration. | `cargo test` passed |
| modified | `docs/*`, `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, plugin docs, web docs | | Refreshed stale auth, ports, plugin, Docker, xtask, schema, testing, and paging guidance. | `just contract-audit` passed |
| modified | `scripts/check-schema-docs.py` | | Generated reserved paging parameter docs. | `python3 scripts/check-schema-docs.py --check` passed |
| modified | `scripts/test-mcp-auth.sh`, `xtask/README.md`, `xtask/src/main.rs` | | Fixed stale default URL/port and xtask command docs. | `just contract-audit` passed |

## Beads Activity

| Bead | Title | Actions | Final status | Why it mattered |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `rmcp-template-yy0` | Harden MCP response paging cursors | Created, claimed, closed | closed | Tracked replay-safe cursor paging, protocol errors, tests, docs, and mcporter verification. |
| `rmcp-template-jhm` | Sweep stale documentation after MCP paging/error updates | Created, claimed, closed | closed | Tracked stale docs sweep, parallel agent findings, docs refresh, and contract-audit repair. |

Observed Beads warnings: `bd update/show` sometimes printed `Warning: auto-export: git add failed: exit status 1`, but tracker reads/writes succeeded and `bd dolt push` completed.

## Repository Maintenance

- Plans: checked `docs/plans`; no files were present, so nothing was moved to `docs/plans/complete/`.
- Beads: closed `rmcp-template-yy0` and `rmcp-template-jhm` after tests, docs checks, commit, and push evidence.
- Worktrees/branches: `git worktree list --porcelain` showed only `/home/jmagar/workspace/rmcp-template`; local and remote branches showed only `main` aligned with `origin/main`, so no cleanup was needed.
- Stale docs: updated stale MCP/auth/deployment/plugin/web/scaffold docs found by local grep and three parallel agents.
- Push state: `git rev-list --left-right --count origin/main...HEAD` returned `0 0` after pushing.

## Tools and Skills Used

- Skill: `save-to-md` for session capture requirements and maintenance checklist.
- Shell: `git`, `cargo`, `just`, `bd`, `mcporter`, `rg`, `sed`, `jq`, `python3`.
- Agents: three read-only explorer agents for independent stale-doc sweeps.
- File edits: `apply_patch` for source, docs, scripts, and this session note.
- External CLI verification: `mcporter` exercised the stdio MCP server. Limitation observed: built-in template actions do not naturally emit a >40 KB result to create a live cursor page.

## Commands Executed

- `cargo test`
- `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`
- `cargo fmt --check`
- `just contract-audit`
- `python3 scripts/check-schema-docs.py --write && python3 scripts/check-schema-docs.py --check`
- `mcporter list --stdio ./target/debug/example --stdio-arg mcp --cwd /home/jmagar/workspace/rmcp-template --name rmcp-template-live --schema --all-parameters --json`
- `mcporter call --stdio ./target/debug/example --stdio-arg mcp --cwd /home/jmagar/workspace/rmcp-template --name rmcp-template-live example --args '{"action":"status"}' --output raw`
- `mcporter call --stdio ./target/debug/example --stdio-arg mcp --cwd /home/jmagar/workspace/rmcp-template --name rmcp-template-live example --args '{"action":"echo","message":"live continuation check","_response_offset":1,"_response_page_bytes":8}' --output raw`
- `git pull --rebase`, `bd dolt push`, `git push`

## Errors Encountered

- Initial continuation test failed because the cached page path did not preserve requested `page_bytes`; fixed by routing cursor requests through cached response formatting.
- `contract-audit` failed after paging changes because `src/mcp/rmcp_server.rs` exceeded the hard line limit; fixed by extracting `src/mcp/response_paging.rs`.
- `contract-audit` then failed because `response_paging.rs` lacked a sibling test file; fixed by moving paging tests to `src/mcp/response_paging_tests.rs`.
- `docs/MCP_SCHEMA.md` became stale after manual edits; fixed by updating `scripts/check-schema-docs.py` and regenerating the doc.

## Behavior Changes (Before/After)

| Before | After |
|---|---|
| Oversized MCP response continuation used offset/page size and risked re-running the original action. | Continuation includes `_response_cursor`; subsequent page calls read cached serialized output. |
| `_response_offset` could be supplied without a cursor. | Offset without cursor returns structured `missing_response_cursor` protocol error. |
| Stale docs contradicted current defaults, routes, plugin versioning, Docker, xtask, and schema behavior. | Docs now match observed source and generated schema checks. |
| `rmcp_server.rs` exceeded the file-size hard limit after paging work. | Paging logic lives in `response_paging.rs`; `contract-audit` passes. |

## Verification Evidence

| Command | Expected | Actual | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cargo test` | Full Rust test suite passes | 214 unit tests plus integration/doc tests passed | pass |
| `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` | No warnings | Completed successfully | pass |
| `cargo fmt --check` | Formatting clean | Completed successfully | pass |
| `just contract-audit` | Template contracts pass | Passed all 6 audit steps | pass |
| `mcporter list ... --schema` | `_response_cursor` in schema | `_response_cursor`, `_response_offset`, `_response_page_bytes` present | pass |
| `mcporter call ... action=status` | Normal MCP call succeeds | Returned status JSON | pass |
| `mcporter call ... _response_offset without cursor` | Protocol error | `_response_cursor is required when _response_offset is set` | pass |
| `git rev-list --left-right --count origin/main...HEAD` | `0 0` | `0 0` | pass |

## Risks and Rollback

- Risk: in-memory response cursors are process-local and expire after 300 seconds, so clients must re-run the original call after restart or expiry. The error payload tells agents to re-run.
- Risk: docs sweep touched broad template guidance; rollback is `git revert 6aee3a3` for the docs/module extraction and `git revert 6fafbe1` for cursor caching if needed.

## Decisions Not Taken

- Did not add a production-only large-response action just to live-test cursor happy path; kept that coverage in Rust tests to avoid expanding the template action surface.
- Did not delete any branches or worktrees because none beyond `main` were registered locally.

## Open Questions

- Whether to wire `src/logging.rs` dual console/file logging by default; docs now state it is available but not enabled.
- Whether to further split `src/app.rs`, `src/mcp/rmcp_server.rs`, and `tests/plugin_contract.rs`, which remain above the target line count but below hard limits.

## Next Steps

- For another hardening pass, split remaining above-target files opportunistically.
- Add a synthetic or fixture-backed live MCP large-response test only if the template gains a natural large-output action.
- Continue using `just contract-audit` after template-wide docs edits; it caught both file-size and generated-doc drift during this session.
