# Crate monorepo planning + dependabot merge train + CI landmine repair

## User Request

Three phases: (1) "list all of our current crates" evolving into "this repo should be the source of truth for all extracted crates we publish to crates.io — I want to port labby-gateway and labby-codemode from ../lab"; (2) "repo status"; (3) "lets get all these dependabot prs merged - ALL of em. /gh-fix-ci fix the failing workflows as well and get that merged."

## Session Overview

Planned the labby-gateway/labby-codemode port into soma (two parallel exploration agents mapped crate overlap and dependency drag; plan recorded in bead `rmcp-template-0lnb`). Then cleared the entire dependabot backlog (18 of 19 PRs merged, typescript 7 excluded for cause and later reverted after a rogue merge), fixed three broken workflows (dependabot auto-merge, rmcp release monitor, OpenWiki Update), and repaired four pre-existing cold-build compile breakages on main that warm CI caches had been masking. Main ended green at `a8f68e2` with OpenWiki verified end-to-end (run 29364937029: `sqlite native binding OK under v24.18.0`).

## Sequence of Events

1. **Crate inventory + monorepo goal.** Listed soma's 13 workspace members; user declared soma the future home for crates extracted from `../lab` (gateway/codemode focus, since soma is naturally becoming a gateway via MCP-server-as-provider).
2. **Parallel exploration.** Two Explore agents: one compared soma↔labby support crates (soma-auth is a vendored ~95% subset fork of labby-auth; soma-runtime/labby-runtime share only a name; soma-web/labby-web coexist; soma-contracts' `ActionSpec` is richer than labby-primitives'), the other mapped gateway/codemode extraction surface (~61k LoC; codemode has no rmcp dep; labby-apis not needed; `labby-runtime` slice + `ssrf` + labby-auth `upstream/` module are the real drag). Port plan recorded in bead `rmcp-template-0lnb` (5 waves).
3. **Repo status** (vibin:repo-status): corrected an earlier false claim about a dirty branch — main was clean; found 19 dependabot PRs all with failing checks, release-please PR #115 conflicted, two failing scheduled workflows.
4. **Workflow diagnosis.** `gh: command not found` on the tootie runner (rmcp monitor + dependabot auto-merge); openwiki better-sqlite3 Node-ABI mismatch; main's own Secret Scan red was a gitleaks SARIF-upload flake (re-run passed); dependabot PR check failures were stale pre-`8423e6d` workflow versions.
5. **PR #118**: gh via `.mise.toml` pin (2.93.0) + mise-action for rmcp monitor; auto-merge job moved to ubuntu-latest; first openwiki rebuild attempt. Merged green.
6. **Merge strategy pivot.** After user pushback on the serialized rebase-per-PR timeline, killed the babysitter loop and built batch **PR #121**: all 19 PR diffs applied (lockfiles excluded) — discovering most were already on main via #117 — then regenerated Cargo.lock (wat chain) and pnpm-lock (in-range bumps). typescript 7 excluded: reproducibly crashes `next build`.
7. **Cold-build landmines.** #121's lock delta forced the first cold compile of deps main already pinned: jsonschema 0.47 API removal (`JSONSchema` → `Validator`, 3 crates ported), sha2 0.11 digests losing `LowerHex` (2 sites hex-encoded), sse-stream 0.2.3 too old for rmcp 2.2 (bumped 0.2.4), reqwest 0.13 rustls-provider panic (ring provider installed in `providers/mcp.rs` — would have crashed production). Plus gate alignment: workflow_shapes SHA assertion, deny.toml MIT-0 allowlist, 800-line PATTERNS.md limit (deduped via `schema_error_details` helper). #121 merged with 22/22 checks green; 18 dependabot PRs closed/superseded.
8. **Mid-flight upstream breakage.** spin 0.9.8 yanked upstream mid-session, failing Cargo Deny repo-wide → **PR #124** (spin 0.9.9).
9. **OpenWiki saga (4 rounds).** #118: `npm rebuild` silently skipped by npm 11 allowScripts. #123: direct install-script run — no-op because prebuild-install skips existing binaries. #125: disabled mise cache — still failed. Instrumented diagnostic dispatch (run 29356180220, from a diag branch via `gh workflow run --ref`) proved the binding file never changes (identical sha256) yet "loads" then "fails". #126: explicit node instead of shim — still failed. Local disproof experiment: **bare `require('better-sqlite3')` succeeds with the binding deleted** — every verify was vacuous; real cause: mise shims resolve per-cwd, so `npm` inside the cd'd package dir (outside the repo) fell back to the runner's system node 22 (ABI 127). **PR #128**: node/npm pinned by absolute path before the cd + verification via real `Database(':memory:')` construction. OpenWiki then passed end-to-end.
10. **Rogue typescript merge.** PR #104 (typescript 7, deliberately excluded) was merged to main at 18:56:52Z by a plain `gh pr merge` under jmagar's token — no auto-merge event, no session script references #104. Broke Frontend Assets/Container Smoke repo-wide. **PR #129** reverted it (verified cold install + build locally first).
11. **Cleanup + closeout.** #122 (setup-node 7, dependabot's recreation of #119) merged; bead m14v closed; merged branches pruned; beads pushed to Dolt; two `bd remember` memories saved.

## Key Findings

- **Warm self-hosted caches masked broken-at-source main.** jsonschema 0.47, sha2 0.11, rmcp 2.2 entered `Cargo.lock` via #117 without ever being cold-compiled; any lockfile change detonated four compile failures. Follow-up: bead `rmcp-template-dydn` (scheduled cold-build CI job).
- **typescript 7 is not an upgrade** — it is the Go-native compiler: `npm view typescript@7.0.2` shows no `main` entry, only a `tsc` bin + 20 platform-native packages. Next 16's `require('typescript')` integration cannot work; only the CLI is drop-in (`tsc --noEmit` passed while `next build` crashed).
- **mise shims resolve per-cwd** ([openwiki-update.yml:31-52](.github/workflows/openwiki-update.yml)): a `cd` outside the repo loses `.mise.toml` pins; GitHub runners ship system node 22 (ABI 127) vs mise node 24 (ABI 137).
- **`require('better-sqlite3')` never dlopens** — only `new Database()` does; require-based native-binding smoke checks are vacuous.
- **reqwest 0.13 (via rmcp 2.2) panics at client build without an installed rustls crypto provider** — fixed at [crates/soma-service/src/providers/mcp.rs](crates/soma-service/src/providers/mcp.rs) (`ensure_rustls_crypto_provider`, ring, matching lab's precedent).
- **soma-auth is a vendored fork of labby-auth** (`DEFAULT_ENV_PREFIX = "LAB"` at crates/soma-auth/src/config.rs:23); labby-auth is a ~95% superset with the `upstream/` OAuth module the gateway port needs.

## Technical Decisions

- **Batch PR over serialized dependabot merges**: one CI cycle instead of ~19; dependabot self-closes superseded PRs. Non-lockfile diffs applied per PR; lockfiles regenerated once (`cargo update -p` limited to named packages; `pnpm update` limited to the named dependency set).
- **Exclude typescript 7 rather than patch around it**: verified against a passing baseline; the ecosystem (Next) must ship native-compiler support first.
- **Upgrade soma-auth to the labby-auth codebase (planned, not executed)** rather than importing labby-auth alongside — kills fork drift and supplies the gateway's upstream-OAuth needs in one move.
- **dependabot-auto-merge on ubuntu-latest**: the job is a 2-step GitHub API call needing no checkout; GitHub-hosted runners ship `gh`.
- **`cache: false` for the OpenWiki workflow**: a daily job affords a fresh install; later made sufficient-but-not-necessary once the real per-cwd shim cause was found (kept anyway as defense in depth).
- **Evidence-first debugging for OpenWiki**: instrumented `workflow_dispatch --ref <branch>` run with checksums instead of a fifth blind fix.

## Beads Activity

| bead | action | status | why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `rmcp-template-0lnb` | created; design recorded (5-wave port plan, dependency map, tech-debt triage, naming) | open | labby-gateway/codemode port into soma — the session's phase-1 deliverable |
| `rmcp-template-m14v` | created, claimed, notes updated ×4, closed | closed | the CI repair epic of this session; close reason documents all fixes + verification |
| `rmcp-template-dydn` | created | open | scheduled cold-build CI job to kill the cache-masking failure class |
| `rmcp-template-56f` | commented | in_progress (unchanged) | stale June "main CI red" epic; noted today's independent repair and its unverified residuals |
| memories | `bd remember` ×2 | — | mise per-cwd shim resolution; bindings-package lazy dlopen |

## Repository Maintenance

- **Plans**: no plan file was created this session. 37 historical files under `docs/plans/` were left untouched — assessing their completion is out of safe scope for this pass (no `docs/plans/complete/` exists; creating one and triaging is follow-up work, not evidence-backed today).
- **Beads**: see table above; `bd dolt push` completed ("Push complete").
- **Worktrees/branches**: my merged branches (`fix/*`, `chore/dependency-batch`, `revert/typescript-7`, `diag/openwiki-abi`) were deleted via `--delete-branch` and a `git branch --merged` prune (evidence: local branch list contains none of them). Left alone: `marketplace-no-mcp` (protected long-lived ref per CLAUDE.md), `codex/provider-drop-in-ux` (open conflicted PR #99, needs a rebase-or-close decision), `codex/pr101-review-fixes` (one unmerged docs commit), `release-please--branches--main--components--soma` (bot-owned, PR #115 still conflicted), three `claude/*`/`codex-*` worktree branches under `.claude/worktrees/` (other agents' active work, e.g. `claude/labby-auth-crate-port-aeb44c` — visibly related to the port plan).
- **Stale docs**: the openwiki workflow now carries accurate in-file comments; durable lessons captured via `bd remember`. `docs/CI.md` was not audited for openwiki/runner-tooling coverage — noted under Next Steps rather than claimed done.
- **Transparency**: commit `a6cebaa` (#125) accidentally swept a pre-existing untracked session file (`docs/sessions/2026-07-14-soma-provider-runtime-dependabot-openwiki.md`, from a different session) into a `git add -A`. Docs-only and harmless, but noted.

## Tools and Skills Used

- **Shell (Bash) + file tools (Read/Write/Edit)**: the bulk — git/gh operations, cargo/pnpm builds, workflow edits, log forensics via `gh run view`/`gh api .../logs`.
- **Explore subagents ×2 (parallel)**: soma↔labby crate comparison; gateway/codemode extraction-surface mapping. Both returned structured reports that became the port plan.
- **Skills**: `vibin:repo-status` (evidence collector + summarizer scripts), `vibin:gh-fix-ci` (workflow), `vibin:merge-status` (invoked earlier; its bundled script hit permission-denied and the user interrupted — superseded by repo-status), `vibin:save-to-md` (this artifact).
- **Background tasks**: ~10 `gh pr checks --watch` merge-watcher pipelines; one 5-minute merge-train loop (killed after strategy pivot — `pkill -f` matched my own command string, exit 144, harmless).
- **beads (`bd`)**: issue tracking, memories, dolt push.
- **AskUserQuestion**: naming/wave-1 scoping; branch strategy (both materially redirected the plan).
- **Issues**: `gh run view --log` returns nothing for in-progress runs (worked around via `gh api /actions/jobs/<id>/logs`); CodeRabbit/Codex/cubic bot comments were mostly rate-limit noise; one cubic finding (workflow_shapes SHA) was real and fixed.

## Commands Executed

| command | result |
|---|---|
| `gh pr merge <n> --squash --delete-branch` (×8: 118, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 128, 129) | all merged green |
| `cargo check/clippy -D warnings/test --workspace` | green after landmine fixes (25 test binaries) |
| `cargo update -p rmcp -p wat` / `-p sse-stream` / `-p spin` | wat 1.253 chain; sse-stream 0.2.4; spin 0.9.9 |
| `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile && pnpm build` (cold) | reproduced ts7 break; green after revert |
| `gh workflow run "OpenWiki Update"` (×6, incl. `--ref` diag) | failures until #128; final run 29364937029 success |
| `node -e "require(better-sqlite3)"` with binding deleted | succeeded — proved require never dlopens |
| `@dependabot rebase` comments (×19 + nudges) | rebases triggered; dependabot self-closed superseded PRs |

## Errors Encountered

- **`gh: command not found`** (tootie runner) → gh pinned via mise / job moved to GitHub-hosted (#118).
- **gitleaks "Upload progress stalled"** on main — flake; re-run passed.
- **`Python launcher not found`** (Build Windows on stale PR runs) — already fixed on main by `8423e6d`; rebases resolved.
- **4 cold-compile failures** (jsonschema/sha2/sse-stream/rustls) — fixed in #121; root cause cache masking.
- **spin 0.9.8 yanked upstream mid-session** — #124.
- **OpenWiki ABI-127 loop (4 failed fixes)** — root cause per-cwd shim resolution + vacuous require checks; fixed in #128, verified.
- **PR #104 rogue merge** (jmagar token, outside this session, no auto-merge event) — reverted in #129; actor unresolved.
- **`pkill -f merge-train`** killed its own caller (pattern matched the command line) — cosmetic.

## Behavior Changes (Before/After)

| area | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| dependabot PRs | 19 open, all red, auto-merge broken | queue empty (ts7 parked with rationale); auto-merge functional |
| rmcp release monitor | failing daily (exit 127) | green (verified dispatch) |
| OpenWiki Update | failing daily since Node 24 bump | green end-to-end (run 29364937029) |
| main cold build | broken at source in 4 ways (masked by caches) | `cargo check/clippy/test` green cold |
| MCP HTTP providers | would panic at first HTTPS client build (no rustls provider) | ring provider installed idempotently |
| typescript | 7.0.2 briefly on main (broken builds) | 6.0.3, parked until Next supports the native compiler |

## Verification Evidence

| command | expected | actual | status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cargo test --workspace` (cold, post-#121 fixes) | all pass | 25/25 suites ok | pass |
| `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` | clean | clean | pass |
| `cargo deny check advisories bans` / `licenses` | ok | ok (post spin + MIT-0) | pass |
| cold `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile && pnpm build` (post-revert) | success | exit 0, static export | pass |
| OpenWiki dispatch post-#128 | success + dlopen proof | run 29364937029 success; `sqlite native binding OK under v24.18.0` | pass |
| rmcp monitor dispatch post-#118 | success | run 29342322989 success | pass |
| `git status --short --branch` at close | clean, synced | `## main...origin/main`, clean | pass |

## Risks and Rollback

- All changes are squash commits on main; each PR reverts cleanly in isolation (`git revert <sha>`). The jsonschema/sha2 ports change error-message formatting (instance-path rendering) — consumers parsing those strings would notice; none known.
- The OpenWiki fix depends on mise install layout (`mise where`, npm-cli.js path); a mise-action major bump could shift paths — the step fails loudly at the dlopen check if so.
- typescript 7 will be re-offered by dependabot eventually; no `.github/dependabot.yml` ignore rule exists (config file not found in repo — likely UI-managed). Re-merge would re-break builds.

## Decisions Not Taken

- **Serialized per-PR rebase+merge train** — killed for a batch PR after user pushback (~19 CI cycles → 1).
- **Auto-merging typescript 7 with compat shims** — no viable shim; ecosystem support required.
- **Deleting `codex/*` / bot branches** — unmerged content or foreign ownership; documented instead.
- **Chasing the exact mise-shim node-resolution internals further** — pinned by absolute path instead; mechanism recorded in `bd remember`.

## Open Questions

- **Who merged PR #104?** Plain `gh pr merge` under jmagar's token at 18:56:52Z, no auto-merge event, no reference in this session's scripts. Another session/terminal with the same token is the leading hypothesis.
- **PR #115 (release-please 0.5.0)** remains conflicted with manual commits on the bot branch — needs resolution before the next release train run.
- **PR #99 / codex branches** — rebase-or-close decisions pending (half of #99's commits already landed via equivalents).
- **Epic `rmcp-template-56f`** — whether `claude/pedantic-lewin-ca0980` Track-1 work ever landed; CodeQL item unverified.
- Where dependabot's config lives (no `.github/dependabot.yml` in-repo despite grouped PRs) — matters for adding a typescript-major ignore rule.

## Next Steps

1. **Start the port** (bead `rmcp-template-0lnb`): branch off green main; wave 1 = labby-runtime slice + ssrf into a new support crate; note the existing `claude/labby-auth-crate-port-aeb44c` worktree already contains labby-auth sync work — reconcile with it before duplicating.
2. **Bead `rmcp-template-dydn`**: add the scheduled cold-build CI job (no sccache, fresh target dir) so cache-masked breakage can't recur.
3. Resolve PR #115 (release-please) and decide PR #99's fate.
4. Optionally add a dependabot ignore for typescript majors once the config location is found.
5. Recommended immediate command for the port: `git checkout -b feat/gateway-codemode-port origin/main` (or reuse the existing labby-auth port worktree as wave 2's base).
