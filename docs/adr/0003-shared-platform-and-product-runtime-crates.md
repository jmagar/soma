# ADR 0003: Split shared platform crates from product runtime crates

## Status

Accepted, 2026-05-26.

## Context

Reusable infrastructure concerns and reusable product capabilities are often
mixed inside a product binary. If shared infrastructure imports product code,
future products inherit unnecessary dependencies and extracted platform crates
cannot stay small.

## Decision

Use two backend crate classes.

Shared platform crates provide reusable infrastructure. Examples include auth,
config, runtime composition, catalog/surface definitions, observability, setup,
and common transport utilities.

Product runtime crates own reusable product capabilities. Examples include
gateway, marketplace, ACP, fleet/nodes, stash, OAuth flows, logs, workspace,
doctor, and service-specific runtime modules.

Allowed backend dependency direction is:

```text
application binary
  -> product runtime crates
  -> shared platform crates
  -> external crates
```

Shared crates must not depend on product runtime crates. Product crates must not
depend on sibling product crates unless an explicit exception is added to that
product's extraction contract.

## Consequences

- Cross-product orchestration belongs in application composition layers or small
  shared interfaces.
- Shared crates must expose narrow public APIs and avoid broad internal
  re-exports.
- Product crates can evolve independently without dragging sibling runtime code
  into consumers.
