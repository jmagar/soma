# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains accepted architecture decisions for `soma` and
the Rust MCP/server family that uses it.

ADRs record decisions that should stay stable across implementation plans,
roadmaps, and temporary migration notes. They complement the topic docs under
`docs/` and should link back to the source material that motivated them.
