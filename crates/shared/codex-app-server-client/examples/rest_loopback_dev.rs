//! Posture 1 of 4: loopback dev — the "just let me try it" REST bridge.
//!
//! This is the lowest-friction way to poke at the REST adapter from your own
//! terminal. It mounts [`codex_app_server_client::rest::trusted_bridge_router`]
//! — the full raw callable/session bridge — with **zero authentication** and
//! binds to `127.0.0.1` by default.
//!
//! ## What this protects
//!
//! Exactly one thing: the OS loopback boundary. Binding to `127.0.0.1` means
//! only processes already running on this machine can open a TCP connection
//! to the port at all. That is the entire protection this example provides.
//!
//! ## What this does NOT protect
//!
//! Everything else. There is no token, no session cookie, no origin check,
//! nothing. Any process on this machine — any other user account able to
//! reach loopback, any browser tab running JavaScript against
//! `http://127.0.0.1:<port>`, any other container sharing this network
//! namespace — gets the same access this example grants a `curl` on the
//! command line: full, unauthenticated use of every route
//! `trusted_bridge_router()` exposes.
//!
//! If the bind address is ever changed away from loopback (a LAN IP,
//! `0.0.0.0`, a container bridge address reachable from sibling containers,
//! a cloud instance's private or public IP) this example does not stop you.
//! It only prints a loud warning. **Do not run this posture anywhere but
//! your own workstation.** For anything beyond a single trusted operator on
//! one machine, use `rest_bearer_auth` (add a token) or `rest_trusted_gateway`
//! (delegate auth to a real gateway) instead.
//!
//! ## What an attacker who reaches this port can do
//!
//! Everything the trusted bridge allows, as the OS user running this
//! process: create and delete Codex app-server sessions, drive turns to
//! completion, call any app-server JSON-RPC method via
//! `POST /v1/call/{method}` or `POST /v1/sessions/{sessionId}/call/{method}`,
//! and observe/answer server-originated requests via the event and
//! request-reply routes. Caller-chosen `command`/`extraArgs`/`config`
//! overrides and `approvalPolicy: "allow_all"` remain rejected here (unsafe
//! client options are off by default — see `rest_admin_unsafe` for that
//! separate, even more dangerous opt-in), but everything the *installed*
//! Codex binary can already do is fair game.
//!
//! ## When this posture is (and isn't) appropriate
//!
//! Appropriate: a single developer, on their own laptop or workstation,
//! experimenting with the REST bridge locally, for as long as the process is
//! running. Not appropriate: CI runners shared with other jobs, containers
//! reachable from sibling containers, multi-user hosts, anything with the
//! bind address overridden away from loopback, or anything left running
//! unattended.
//!
//! Run: `cargo run -p codex-app-server-client --features rest --example rest_loopback_dev`
//!
//! Try it:
//! ```text
//! curl http://127.0.0.1:43220/health
//! curl http://127.0.0.1:43220/v1/compatibility
//! ```
