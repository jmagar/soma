//! Optional bearer-token auth layer for the REST adapter.
//!
//! **This is transport auth only.** It answers exactly one question: did the
//! caller present the configured secret? It says nothing about
//! authorization (which sessions/methods a caller may touch), multi-tenant
//! isolation, or sandboxing of the underlying `codex app-server` process -
//! those remain entirely the host application's responsibility, same as
//! documented for the REST adapter as a whole in README.md. A caller that
//! presents the one shared token gets everything the mounted router exposes.
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use codex_app_server_client::rest;
//!
//! # fn build() -> axum::Router {
//! rest::trusted_bridge_router().layer(rest::bearer_auth("super-secret-token"))
//! # }
