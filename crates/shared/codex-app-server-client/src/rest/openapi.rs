//! OpenAPI 3.1.0 document for the `rest` module's HTTP surface.
//!
//! [`openapi_spec`] hand-builds a `serde_json::Value` describing every route
//! in [`super::routes`] rather than deriving it from the Rust types via a
//! schema-generation crate (`schemars`, `utoipa`, ...). That's a deliberate
//! trade-off, not an oversight: this crate promises zero path-dependencies
//! and a minimal, audited `crates.io` dependency footprint (see
//! `README.md`), and every schema-derive crate considered pulls in either a
//! proc-macro-heavy dependency tree or its own opinionated JSON Schema
//! dialect that doesn't map onto OpenAPI 3.1 cleanly (`serde`'s
//! `rename_all_fields` internally-tagged enums in particular - see
//! [`RestEventResponse`](super::types::RestEventResponse) - have no clean
//! derive-crate story as of this writing). Hand-writing means every schema
//! below is transcribed by reading `src/rest/types.rs` and `src/compat.rs`
//! directly; the tests at the bottom of this file exist specifically to
//! catch that transcription drifting from the real wire format or the real
//! mounted routes.
//!
//! # Determinism
//!
//! This crate does not enable `serde_json`'s `preserve_order` feature, so in
//! an ordinary standalone build `serde_json::Map` is backed by a
//! `BTreeMap` and serializes with sorted keys automatically. But Cargo
//! unifies feature flags across an entire build's unit graph: when this
//! crate is built as part of the full `soma` workspace (rather than in
//! isolation with `cargo test -p codex-app-server-client`), sibling crates
//! that *do* enable `preserve_order` (see `crates/shared/openapi/Cargo.toml`,
//! `crates/shared/codemode/Cargo.toml`) flip `serde_json::Map` to an
//! insertion-order-preserving `IndexMap` for every crate in that build,
//! including this one - see `xtask/Cargo.toml`'s comment on the same
//! incident for prior art. `json::obj` below builds every JSON object in
//! this module by sorting its entries before insertion, so
//! [`openapi_spec`]'s serialized output is byte-identical either way.
//! [`serde_json::json!`] is still used freely for arrays and scalar leaves,
//! where element order is meaningful (arrays) or there's nothing to order
//! (leaves) - only object-shaped literals go through `json::obj`.
//!
//! # Module layout
//!
//! This document has three natural pieces, plus the shared low-level JSON
//! builders they're all built from:
//!
//! - [`json`] - generic, schema-agnostic JSON/JSON-Schema value builders
//!   (`obj`, `schema_ref`, `object_schema`, ...).
//! - [`schemas`] - `components.schemas`, i.e. [`schemas::build_schemas`].
//! - [`route_table`] - the single source-of-truth route table ([`route_table::ROUTES`])
//!   read by both [`paths`] and this file's own coverage tests.
//! - [`paths`] - `paths`, i.e. [`paths::build_paths`], including every
//!   per-operation request/response/parameter builder.
