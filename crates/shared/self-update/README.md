# soma-self-update

`soma-self-update` is a standalone binary self-update transaction for Rust services. It has zero path-dependencies on the Soma workspace and can be copied into another repository wholesale.

## Scope

The crate owns artifact integrity checks, bounded staging, executable validation,
atomic Unix installation, durable confirmation state, and rollback.

The default policy streams at most 128 MiB and gives a staged executable 10
seconds to answer `--version`. Validation requires the advertised version as an
exact output token rather than a substring. Install captures the validated
artifact identity and rechecks its digest, device, and inode under the
transaction lock, including a final check immediately before replacement.

## Non-goals

Release discovery, HTTP and authentication, signature format and key
management, service orchestration, server-side artifact hosting, and automatic
Cortex or Soma integration remain adopter responsibilities.

## Safety boundary

Authenticate the directive independently or verify a detached signature before
starting an update. A same-channel SHA-256 digest does not authenticate a
hostile publisher. Verify any detached signature before calling `stage`.

Artifacts are same-origin by default and HTTPS-only. Loopback HTTP is available
only through explicit `HttpsOrLoopbackHttp` policy. URL references use URL
semantics, so endpoint `https://host/v1/heartbeats` plus
`/v1/agent/binary` resolves to `https://host/v1/agent/binary`, not a path under
the heartbeat endpoint. Transport adapters must disable automatic redirects or
call `validate_artifact_response_url` for every redirect target and the final
response URL; validating only the initial URL does not constrain a client's
redirect behavior.

## Platform support

Transport-neutral directive, staging, and validation APIs compile everywhere.
Validator timeouts terminate the full Unix process group or Windows Job Object,
including descendants that inherit the output pipes. Cancelling or dropping a
validation future triggers the same process-tree termination guard. After the
leader exits, validation explicitly terminates and drains that process tree
before accepting its captured status and output, so a successful candidate
cannot leave a helper running after closing inherited pipes.
Exclusive partial-file creation establishes cleanup ownership: a staging-path
collision is reported without deleting or modifying the preexisting entry.
The included atomic installer and re-exec adapter support Unix only.
Non-Unix adopters can use directive, staging, and validation but the provided
installer reports `UnsupportedPlatform`; supply a platform-specific deployment
strategy there.

## API lifecycle

Construct an `UpdateDirective`, stage and validate its artifact, install it,
restart, recover pending state on startup, and confirm only after the new
service reports healthy.

The configured executable leaf must be a regular path, not a symlink. The
crate rejects leaf symlinks before staging or recovery so the staging grammar,
marker identity, backup identity, and installed target cannot diverge. Symlinked
executable parent directories are canonicalized consistently. State paths must
already be canonical and may not contain symlinked components, including a
dangling symlink leaf. Relative executable and state paths are bound to the
construction-time current directory, so later process current-directory changes
cannot redirect staging, installation, recovery, or confirmation to another
target.

`recover_on_startup` also reclaims prior-process staging and orphan rollback
files only when their exact target-derived grammar, regular-file type,
directory, Unix owner, and dead creator PID prove they are stale crate-owned
artifacts. Live concurrent stages are preserved. Protected identities are
canonicalized, matching symlinks are never followed, and another executable's
files are untouched. Calling startup recovery before each service loop therefore
bounds crash leftovers across process restarts. Marker input is capped at 64
KiB. Failed staging explicitly reports both the operation and cleanup error;
automatic `Drop` cleanup is reserved as a best-effort cancellation fallback.
On Unix each partial begins mode `0600` even under a permissive umask; after the
digest matches, staging changes it through the still-open descriptor to exact
mode `0700` for validation. The named staged artifact never inherits setuid,
setgid, group, or other permissions from the installed executable. Staging
resolves the executable once, rejects a symlink leaf, and reads its intended
full mode and device/inode identity through a no-follow descriptor. Installation
revalidates that captured identity under the transaction locks, so replacing or
retargeting the executable between staging and install cannot supply a stale
permission mode.

Installation acquires sorted, deduplicated advisory locks derived from both the
canonical executable and state identities. The executable-derived lock is a
stable inode used only for serialization. A separate mode-`0600` authority
sidecar durably records the one authoritative state identity as a versioned,
length-delimited, SHA-256-checksummed record. Authority changes use a
file-synced temporary, atomic rename, and parent-directory sync, so a crash
cannot truncate the stable lock or leave a partial record authoritative. Safe
partial temporaries are reclaimed under the executable lock; malformed,
symlinked, foreign-owner, or incorrectly permissioned authority files fail
closed. A later updater constructed with the same executable and a different
state path is rejected even after the first process exits. The state-derived
lock preserves serialization for multiple executables sharing one state file. The
executable directory and state directory must not be writable by untrusted
principals; no pathname-based installer can close the final metadata-to-rename
race against an attacker who controls that directory. Installation writes and
syncs a durable marker with explicit `prepared`, `installed`, `rolling_back`,
and `rolled_back` phases. Marker replacement uses one deterministic mode-`0600`,
lock-protected `<state>.tmp` sibling; startup recovery validates and reclaims an
effective-user-owned regular-file leftover before reading transaction state.
The authoritative marker itself is opened with Unix no-follow and nonblocking
flags, then its descriptor must be a current-effective-user-owned regular file
with exactly mode `0600` and no special bits before any bounded read, preventing
symlink traversal, FIFO stalls, and access through unexpected state permissions.
Serialized state is capped at the same 64 KiB limit on both writes and reads.
Before backup creation or executable replacement, installation preflights the
largest reachable phase and attempt-count representation so later recovery
writes cannot outgrow that cap. Generated rollback paths are
checked with the same filesystem-alias-aware predicate used by layout and
migration validation before the backup is created. Primary layout validation
likewise rejects aliases among the executable, state, marker temporary,
authority, authority temporary, executable lock, and state lock before any lock
or authority file is created; each generated staging path is added to that
namespace before its partial file is created.
The advisory lock is also created mode `0600`, opened no-follow/nonblocking,
and descriptor-validated as a current-effective-user-owned regular file. An
owned legacy lock with broader permissions or special bits is repaired to exact
mode `0600`, synced, and re-checked before its exclusive lock is acquired.
The transaction retains a unique rollback backup, records its actual owner in
the marker, syncs the backup and its directory before the marker may reference
it, then atomically renames the verified artifact. Copy destinations begin with
the source executable mode before any bytes are written. Unix
staging records the existing executable mode (falling back to restrictive
`0700` only when no target exists) separately from the staged file's validation
mode. Installation applies the intended full mode, including any source setuid
or setgid bits, through the validated descriptor only at the final locked install
boundary, then syncs and rechecks identity and mode immediately before
replacement. Validator-side permission changes therefore cannot install a
non-executable or prematurely privileged target. Adopters that do not want to
preserve special bits must remove them from the installed executable before
staging. Copy-based rollback backups preserve the same mode.
`BackupStrategy::Copy` is available when an adopter cannot use hard links or
wants to exercise the copy path explicitly.
A process crash at any marker, swap, or rollback boundary is completed or
aborted idempotently by startup recovery. Each unconfirmed startup increments
the marker only after hashing the installed executable against the verified
target digest; changed bytes preserve recovery state and return an error. After
the configured threshold the digest-verified backup is
restored and the adopter must restart again. Successful health confirmation
rehashes the installed executable against the verified target digest before
durably removing the authoritative marker and cleaning the backup. Changed
bytes retain both marker and backup; a cleanup interruption after confirmation
can leave only a harmless orphan backup.
Copy-based backup creation owns its destination only after exclusive creation;
copy, permission, or sync failures durably remove the partial backup and report
both the operation and cleanup errors if removal cannot be completed.
After either copy or hard-link creation, reopen, metadata, file-sync, and
directory-sync failures use the same durable, combined-error cleanup contract.
If writing the prepared marker fails after its rename, cleanup durably removes
marker state before the backup; failure to remove state retains the backup for
recovery rather than leaving a marker that references a deleted rollback.
Install requires the validated artifact to remain in the currently resolved
executable directory and match that executable's exact staging-name grammar.
Artifacts from another updater layout, from a sibling executable in the same
directory, or staged before an executable-parent symlink retarget are rejected
before lock creation or transaction mutation.
If mode, identity, or digest validation fails after a prepared marker is
durable but before replacement, the installer durably removes that marker
first and then removes the rollback backup. Cleanup failures retain the primary
validation error and leave either a recoverable marker-plus-backup pair or an
unreferenced backup, never a marker whose backup was deleted first.
A running-version mismatch retains both marker and backup and returns a typed
error; an operator must inspect that identity mismatch before explicitly
removing recovery state. Corrupt markers, missing
backups, and cleanup failures are typed errors and retain diagnostic state where
possible. Operators should stop competing updater processes before repairing a
reported marker or backup path.

Use `Updater::migrate_state_file` to intentionally move an executable's state
authority. The method acquires the executable lock and both old and new state
locks in sorted order, verifies the current authority, and atomically rewrites
the sidecar. Before creating any lock or authority file, it rejects collisions
between either marker/marker-temporary namespace and every old/new lock,
authority, and authority-temporary path. Existing paths are compared by
filesystem identity and canonical path. Because destination leaves can be
absent, parent directories are matched by canonical path or Unix device/inode
identity so bind-style aliases cannot bypass validation. Differing all-ASCII
names under the same directory are compared ASCII-case-insensitively. Any
differing leaf containing non-ASCII or invalid
UTF-8 bytes is conservatively treated as a possible alias because portable
Unicode normalization and full case-fold behavior varies by filesystem. This
intentionally rejects some distinct names on case-sensitive filesystems, but
keeps validation side-effect-free and safe for case-insensitive mounts. It also
refuses an initial migration while either
marker path, either marker temporary, or any exact staged/rollback recovery
artifact exists. This makes pending and indeterminate transactions explicit
operator work instead of silently orphaning recovery state.
`MigrationOutcome::Migrated` carries the updater bound to the new state after
the authority and directory are durable. `MigratedIndeterminate` also carries
that new updater when the authority rename succeeded but directory sync failed;
callers must retain it and log the diagnostic rather than returning to the old
state path. `MigrationOutcome::into_updater` handles both variants safely.
Retrying the same migration is idempotent and confirms the directory boundary.
Once authority already names the destination, the retry does not reapply the
pre-migration cleanliness checks, so a transaction safely started with the
returned updater is not disturbed.

The public install, startup-recovery, and confirmation methods are async for
service integration, but their synchronous hashing, copying, advisory locking,
and filesystem durability work runs on Tokio blocking workers rather than an
async executor worker. Once dispatched, a transaction continues to its durable
boundary even if the awaiting future is cancelled.

## Cortex extraction map

- Cortex `AgentUpdateDirective` maps to `UpdateDirective`.
- Cortex reqwest and bearer authentication stay in Cortex caller code.
- Cortex `maybe_update` splits into `stage` → `validate` → `install` → caller
  restart/re-exec.
- The first successful heartbeat calls `confirm_success`; startup calls
  `recover_on_startup` before entering the heartbeat loop.

See `examples/heartbeat_agent.rs` for a compile-checked lifecycle. The library
never reads global process arguments. Pass the arguments to preserve to
`restart_command` or `reexec`, or let a supervisor such as systemd restart the
service after either install outcome. `RestartRequired` means the swap and
installed marker both completed. `RestartRequiredIndeterminate` means the
executable was already swapped but a following durability or marker step
failed; its diagnostic error must be logged, but the caller must still restart
and let startup recovery reconcile the prepared marker.
