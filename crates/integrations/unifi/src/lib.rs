// A library crate should never panic on data it doesn't control. Scoped to
// non-test builds only — `.unwrap()`/`.expect()` in test code is normal,
// idiomatic Rust, not a smell, and this crate's test suite uses both
// extensively and correctly. The handful of non-test sites this denies by
// default all have a documented, build-time-only justification (a bundled
// data file that ships with the crate, not caller input) and are
// explicitly `#[allow]`'d at that exact site — this exists so a *new*
// unwrap/expect/panic in production code has to be a deliberate, reviewed
// choice, not an accident.
